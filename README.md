# Product Price Tracker
This python bot will help you get the best deal.
You can give it link of the product you want to buy and the expected price you want it for, it will keep checking if the price has dropped.
Once it gets the price below your expected price, it'll send you an email with the link to purchase it immediately.

Till now it has only for Amazon but I'll keep adding same for different websites too.
If you want to contribute in making similar scripts for different websites feel free to contribute here.
Thanks.
